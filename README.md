## Wireframes
 
 Approach : Wireframing was key in designing the layout of my portfolio. It was also important to stay organize since I had severals pages to code. I kept a detailed checklist of everything I need to do to create a functioning website. Previous I have focused on the UI but I wanted to take my time to create an app that was functional.

### Next Steps / Unsolved Problems

For my portfolio I would like to add all of my software engineer and ux designs projects. Create a cohesive layout and implement more API's. And showcase more of my personality by working on UI and adding cool animations and images.
